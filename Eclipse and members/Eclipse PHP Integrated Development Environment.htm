<H1>Introduction</H1>
<P>The PHP IDE Project is a proposed open-source project under the Eclipse Tools 
Project. This document describes the content and the scope of the proposed 
project.</P>
<P>This proposal is in the <A 
href="http://www.eclipse.org/projects/dev_process/proposal-phase.php">Project 
Proposal Phase</A> and is written to declare its intent and scope. This proposal 
is written to solicit additional participation and input from the Eclipse 
community. You are invited to comment on and/or join the project. Please send 
all feedback to the <A 
href="news://news.eclipse.org/eclipse.tools.php">news://news.eclipse.org/eclipse.tools.php</A> 
newsgroup.
<P>
<H1>Background</H1>
<P>PHP started as an open source project about 10 years ago. During the last 10 
years, PHP has gained significant momentum with now more than 23 million Web 
domains running PHP. PHP’s simplicity and low cost of ownership have all 
contributed to the fast and wide adoption of the language. PHP has now reached 
the point of maturity where organizations are seeking standard tools and 
solutions that will further facilitate application development with PHP.</P>
<H1>Project Goal</H1>
<P>The PHP IDE project will deliver a PHP Integrated Development Environment 
framework for the Eclipse platform. This project will encompass the development 
components necessary to develop PHP-based Web Applications and will facilitate 
extensibility. It will leverage the existing Web Tools Project in providing 
developers with PHP capabilities. </P>
<H1>Project Scope</H1>
<P>The project will contribute an initial set of Eclipse plug-ins that will add 
PHP IDE capabilities to Eclipse, and will provide APIs to further extend the 
functionality of the project. The project will be composed of a set of 
extensible features covering the development life cycle of PHP including 
functionality that deals with developing, deploying, documenting, debugging and 
testing PHP-based applications. </P>
<P>The next section describes in detail the design, features and extension 
points needed in order to provide a comprehensive IDE. </P>
<H1>Project Description</H1>
<H2>Functional Requirements</H2>The PHP IDE Project will include the following 
components: 
<H3>PHP IDE Core</H3>The PHP IDE Core provides the infrastructure for the PHP 
IDE and includes: 
<UL>
  <LI>PHP Language Model - provides infrastructure for the PHP language and the 
  most popular extensions. This Core component is the basis of all PHP language 
  classes, functions and constants and it will support both PHP 4 and PHP 5. The 
  two PHP major versions support will affect the code assist, syntax coloring 
  and PHP Functions view. 
  <LI>PHP Inspector / Code Builder - analyzes PHP language elements such as: 
  classes, functions, constants, variables, include statements, PHPDoc blocks 
  and errors. The PHP Inspector component is based on the PHP language Lexer and 
  Parser and provides analysis for all PHP source code in either PHP 4 or PHP 5. 

  <LI>PHPDoc Support - provides infrastructure that helps overcome some of the 
  PHP language complexities. It adds capabilities to the PHP Language model and 
  the PHP Inspector. 
  <LI>PHP User Model - provides an API for navigating through PHP inspected data 
  (PHP classes, functions, constants, variables and include statements). Used by 
  the search engine, Code Assist and PHP Explorer View. 
  <LI>PHP Source Code Formatter - Format PHP code according to personal 
  preferences. The tool works in tandem with the Web Tools Project formatter. 
  </LI></UL>
<H3>PHP IDE UI</H3>The PHP IDE UI provides the user interface for the PHP IDE. 
It includes several contributions to the Eclipse workbench: 
<UL>
  <LI>PHP Editor – The PHP Editor is built over the Web Tools Structured Editor 
  and should inherit all its capabilities and actions. The PHP as a Structured 
  Editor allows working on more then one programming language at the same time. 
  All features in the PHP Editor support both PHP 4 and PHP 5. 
  <LI>PHP Outline View – Supports two types of Outline Views:
  <UL>
    <LI>PHP specific - shows the structure of an inspected PHP file (classes, 
    functions, variables, include files and constants). 
    <LI>Generic web view - shows an HTML structural View – inherited from the 
    Web Tools Project. </LI></UL>
  <LI>Project Outline View - Very similar to the Outline View except that it 
  shows the structure of an entire PHP Project. 
  <LI>PHP Explorer View - PHP element hierarchy of the PHP projects in the 
  workbench. It provides a PHP specific view of the resources shown in the 
  Navigator. 
  <LI>PHP Language View - A graphical representation of the PHP language Model. 
  <LI>PHP Manual View - An offline view of the official PHP Manual 
  (http://www.php.net/download-docs.php). </LI></UL>The UI will also provide the 
following functionalities: 
<UL>
  <LI>PHP Searching – Integrated in the Eclipse workbench’s search dialog, finds 
  declarations of PHP classes, functions, constants and variables. 
  <LI>Open PHP Type Dialog - Similar to JDT’s open Type dialog, the PHP open 
  type dialog will show all PHP types in the workspace in order to open the 
  selected type in the Editor. </LI></UL>
<H3>PHP IDE Debug</H3>The PHP IDE debug provides the infrastructure for PHP 
debugging, implemented on top of the debug model provided by the Eclipse 
Platform Debugger and on top of the Web Tools Projects. The PHP IDE will support 
both types of PHP Servers: PHP local web server and PHP executable. The debug 
protocol is based on Zend Studio’s debug protocol with extension points for new 
protocol messages. 
<H4>Debug Perspective</H4>The Debug Perspective will be based on the Eclipse 
Debug Perspective with compliance to the relevant PHP Debug actions. The 
perspective will contain the standard debug views. 
<H4>Debug Preview </H4>The Preview view will display what will be rendered on 
the browser as a result of processing the PHP file that is being edited. This 
will be part of a Multi-Page Editor, which will contain a Source page and a 
Preview page aggregated in a Tabbed Container. 
<H2>Extension Points</H2>The following list is work in progress and will most 
likely expand as requirements are identified. The PHP IDE project will provide 
extension points to facilitate the extensibility of the project. The extensions 
points will provide the ability to 
<UL>
  <LI>Extend the debug communication protocol, between the PHP IDE and the Web 
  Server, with new messages. This will enable to increase the debugging 
  capabilities with new features and functions. 
  <LI>Integrate additional PHP builders. 
  <LI>Extend the PHP data models by providing new data model that will reflect 
  code assist and outline view. 
  <LI>Launch of a PHP project on any Web server. </LI></UL>In addition, the PHP 
IDE project will define several extension points to enhance the PHP Editor. The 
extensions points will provide the ability to 
<UL>
  <LI>Add new folding structured (regions) for the PHP Editor (similar to 
  org.eclipse.jdt.ui.foldingStructureProviders) 
  <LI>Enhance the PHP IDE with new text hover to the PHP Editor </LI></UL><IMG 
src="Eclipse PHP Integrated Development Environment_files/picture1.gif"><BR>
<P>The PHP IDE project will be built using several Eclipse Web Tools Platform 
(WTP) project components. The WTP provide generic, extensible and 
standards-based tools for Web-centric application development. It provides 
editors for various Web centric languages such as: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, WSDL, 
etc. In addition, WTP provides facilities for configuring and connecting to Web 
Servers. The PHP IDE will use the WTP Server facilities to manage and configure 
Web Servers. PHP IDE project will benefit from the client web development 
support, already available in the WTP (HTML, CSS, etc) and will add the server 
side web development support (PHP). The integration between the PHP IDE and WTP 
will provide the PHP IDE’s users with a comprehensive solution for WEB 
development. </P>
<P>Main plug-ins: 
<UL>
  <LI>PHP Editor, will extend the WTP’s Structure Editor. The Editor will add 
  PHP support to the Structured Editor using PHP Lexical Analyzer for the PHP 
  language. The use of the WTP’s Structure Editor as a baseline for the extended 
  functionality will provide the PHP developer with the benefits and 
  capabilities that are already available with the WTP editor. 
  <LI>Debugger - The debugger communication protocol between the IDE and the 
  server side in the PHP IDE will be based on Zend’s proven debugging protocol. 
  This protocol defines the agreed-upon format for transmitting data between 
  both the server and the client side in order to facilitate debugging of a PHP 
  application. The debug protocol will support PHP web server debugging and PHP 
  stand-alone application debugging. Debug initiation will be done through an 
  HTTP request made to the debugger server side, then the debugger server will 
  open a communication channel to the PHP IDE to start debugging communication. 
  <LI>Inspection – The PHP IDE will make use of an existing Zend inspection 
  model and tool for parsing PHP code. The PHP parser establishes a model 
  constructed by file data for each of the project files. Each file’s data 
  includes: classes, functions, constants, errors and include file data. The 
  model is used for Code Assist, Outline View, Project Outline View and PHP 
  Explorer View. The model is updated while you type in the editor and for every 
  change in the PHP Project’s structure. </LI></UL>
<H1>Code contributions</H1>Zend and IBM will be making an initial code 
contribution that will encompass the core functionality for the PHP project 
including: 
<UL>
  <LI>High-quality and proven PHP model infrastructure incl. editor, syntax 
  highlighting, code completion, and PHP explorer 
  <LI>PHP perspectives 
  <LI>PHP debugging capabilities </LI></UL>
<H1>Development Plan</H1>We plan to have an initial prototype version available 
by the end of Q1/2006. After the availability of the initial version we will 
work on incorporating changes and feedback as needed and strive to release the 
first functional version as early as possible.
